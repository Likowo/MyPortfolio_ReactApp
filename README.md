Hi there! Welcome to my very first Portfolio built with reactapp, to showcase a couple of my very first projects and skills, to clients and potential employers.

I am a full-stack software engineer student at Per Scholas bootcamp. My portfolio provides information about me, links you to a couple of my first projects, my resume and cover letter, projects still in construction and how to contact me. I believe everyday is a new day with new beginings and new learning opportunities.

I used HTML/CSS/Javascript and react.js to build this application. Dependencies installed included; axios,react,react-dom, react-hook-form and react-router-dom. 

A challenge I faced was with linking my pages via the navigation bar using routes and the react-router-dom. I typed in the Link element with a lowercase letter (l) instead of upppercase (L). It took me hours to realize that the wrongly spelled word had a different color( blue) to the rightly spelled word(bright green). This is a common mistake anyone can make, especially newbies like me! Error message was; ERROR in ./src/components/NavBar.jsx   Module build failed (from ./node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js): Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <link>. (26:6)

Unresolved issues: 1. github react pagefor Spacebook project deployed but life page not loading currently
2. Author for random quotes API pulling up name of site (type.fit) and not author's name. Author name displays in console only.
3.Would love to hide quote so it only displays when button is clicked
4. The Open Resume in a new window button works but some things throws an error about wrong path used or forgetting to export.
5. Selecting specific projects from my github api to include in my In-Contruction page. Not all projects are being worked on at the same time.


I built this app using a code editor called Visual Studio Code ( VS Code). You can download it for free using this link; https://code.visualstudio.com/

A reference marterial I used for building forms in react is from freecodecamp.org. I combined both controlled and uncontrolled components methods.

Used information on getting a random integer between two values , from : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random#getting_a_random_integer_between_two_values

Created a cool spinning button with help from ; https://egghead.io/lessons/css-use-css-keyframes-to-create-a-basic-loading-animation

In my collab project (SpaceBook), I worked with the following teammates; Jenna Coulter (https://github.com/jennac0312 ); Doug Deckert (https://github.com/takilesi) and Matthew Sanders(https://github.com/mattlotus ).Check out their githubs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
